      <description>The following example can be regarded as a generalization of Pigeonhole Principle.
 Example 1
If every person likes at least $1/3$ of the books in a library, then the library has a book, which at least $1/3$ of people like.
 Proof: Suppose there are $N$ people in total and $B$ books in the library. Let all the people leave a mark on the books they like, then there are at least $NB/3$ marks.</description>
